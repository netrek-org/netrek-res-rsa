1. What is Netrek RES-RSA?

RES-RSA is an implementation of the RSA public key cipher.  It is used for
verification purposes to validate Netrek clients that connect to RSA-enabled
servers.  Without RES-RSA, it would be easy for anyone to download the client
source code and add "borgish" features (such as auto-phasers, leading-torps and
visible cloakers) to cheat at the game.  With RES-RSA, this kind of cheating
becomes more difficult, but not impossible.


2. Who wrote RES-RSA?

Ray Jones is the original author of most of the code.  Sam Shen is the original
author of mkkey.  Other contributors include Nick Trown, Alec Habig, Kurt
Siegl, Dave Ahn, Bob Tanner and probably another dozen or so people.


3. Where can I download RES-RSA?

RES-RSA development is located under the Netrek project at Launchpad
(https://launchpad.net/netrek-res-rsa) as of 2009.  RES-RSA was previously
hosted at SourceForge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/netrek) where historical
versions may be found until the migration is complete.

The source code is available at the following sites:
	http://ftp.netrek.org/pub/netrek/rsa/
	http://launchpad.net/netrek-res-rsa
	http://sourceforge.net/project/netrek


4. Do I need to download RES-RSA?

Most people don't need to.  If you're interested in playing Netrek, then you
can download a precompiled RSA-enabled, "blessed" client binary from
http://www.netrek.org/ and not worry about RES-RSA.  If you're interested in
creating a "blessed" client, then you will need both the client source code and
the RES-RSA source code.  If you're interested in running an RSA-enabled
server, you will also need RES-RSA.


5. How do I install and/or use RES-RSA?

Detailed instructions are available in the INSTALL file.


6. I'm having problems with RES-RSA.  Where can I get help?

If you discover a bug, please submit a bug report to the Netrek Developers
mailing list at netrek-dev@lists.netrek.org.


7. Isn't RSA patented?

The RSA algorithm was patented in the United States.  Ray Jones
received special permission from RSA Labs to use the RSA algorithm for
Netrek and to distribute the source code and compiled binaries for
non-commercial purposes.  Dave Ahn verified this permission again with
RSA Labs in 1999.  On September 6, 2000, RSA Security Inc released the RSA
algorithm into Public Domain, two weeks in advance of the expiration date
of the patents (September 20, 2000).  RSA can now be used freely without
restriction within the U.S.

Outside of the United States, the legality of the use of RES-RSA
depends upon local, state and national laws governing those users.  But
in general, most users in the western hemisphere are free to use and
distribute RES-RSA.


8. What about U.S. export regulations?

Up until January 14, 2000, it was nearly impossible to export any kind
of cryptographic software.  The distribution of RES-RSA was strictly
controlled according to guidelines set forth by the Bureau of Export
Administration (BXA).  In fact, prior to March 13, 2000, there was a
European version of RES-RSA that was identical in functionality to the
U.S. RES-RSA.  Fortunately, the regulations changed.  RES-RSA now
qualifies as "open source" software that falls under the license
exception.  Under this exception, royalty-free cryptographic software
source code may be exported without a BXA export license so long as
certain conditions are met.  Dave Ahn has confirmed RES-RSA's license
exception with BXA.
