Installation procedure for the RES-RSA package
--

As of U.S. RES-RSA 2.9.1 and Euro RES-RSA 2.9, all non-crypto code has
been merged to provide a consistent interface.  The only differences
between the two packages are the rsa_encode* and mkkey.c files.

For the Vanilla server, simply untar this package into the
Vanilla/res-rsa directory before running the configure script.  RSA
support will be automatically detected and built into the server.  If
you have GMP installed and wish to use the GMP enabled version of RSA,
change the RSA_* defines in the server's system.mk to use "-lrsa-gmp"
instead of "-lrsa".  If GMP is installed in a non-standard location,
specify the directory to configure with the "--with-gmp=dir" option,
e.g. "--with-gmp=/usr/gnu" or "--with-gmp="../gmp-2.0.2".

For Netrek clients, untar this package into a temporary directory,
then type './configure; make mkkey' to create the client key generator
program.  If configure cannot find the GMP include and library paths,
you may need to specify it as a configure option.  Note that unlike
server-side RSA support, the client-side RSA suport REQUIRES GMP 1.3.2
or later.  Run the mkkey program in your client source directory with
the appropriate arguments.  It will create rsa_box*.c files and the
RSA keypair needed to build an RSA-enabled client.

If you need the GMP package, get it from the GNU archives at
	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gmp/
or from
	ftp://ftp.netrek.org/pub/netrek/gmp/

Both gmp-1.3.2 and gmp-2.0.2 have been tested to work.
