Additional comments for U.S. RES-RSA users.

--

The export of cryptographic software is regulated by the Bureau of
Export Administration (BXA).  RES-RSA source code is posted to the
Internet via FTP and SourceForge (http://sourceforge.net) under the
export license exception clause.

There is a prohibition on direct and knowing transfers to countries
that the U.S. has under sanction (Iran, Cuba, Iraq, Libya, Syria,
Sudan, North Korea).  You may not send this code directly to these
places via e-mail or other modes of transfer without a license from
the BXA.  Fortunately, posting RES-RSA on the Internet does not
establish knowledge of such direct and unlawful export even if someone
from the sanctioned countries happens to download the source code.
However, IF YOU WISH TO EXPORT THIS SOFTWARE THROUGH DIRECT MEANS TO
ANY COUNTRY, YOU SHOULD VERIFY THE LEGALITY BEFORE PROCEEDING.
